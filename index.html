          <h3>Understanding Undo and Redo Using Stacks</h3>
          <p>
            This project uses two stacks to manage changes in the text area: an
            <strong>Undo Stack</strong> and a <strong>Redo Stack</strong>. Each
            time you make a change, it’s saved as an "action" in these stacks to
            enable undo and redo functionality. <br /><br />

            <strong>Undo Stack:</strong> Think of the undo stack as a "history"
            of changes. Every time you make a new change, it’s pushed (added)
            onto the undo stack. When you click "Undo," the most recent action
            is popped (removed) from this stack, and the text area reverts to
            its previous state. <br /><br />

            <strong>Redo Stack:</strong> When you undo an action, that action is
            pushed onto the redo stack. If you decide to redo it, the last
            action from the redo stack is popped and re-applied to the text
            area. This allows you to "redo" the change you previously undid.
            <br /><br />

            <strong><h3>How It Works:</h3></strong>
            - Each change is treated as an "action" and recorded in the stacks.
            - <strong>Undo</strong> uses the undo stack to go back in your
            changes by popping the last action. - <strong>Redo</strong> uses the
            redo stack to re-apply actions that were undone. <br /><br />
            These stacks work in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, meaning the
            most recent action is always the first to be undone or redone.
